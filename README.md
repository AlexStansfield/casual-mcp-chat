# Casual MCP Chat

A Streamlit-based chat interface for [Casual MCP](https://github.com/alexstansfield/casual-mcp).

Install with `pip install casual-mcp-chat` and run using the `casual-mcp-chat` command

On first run the CLI will create a `prompt-templates` directory and a
`casual_mcp_config.json` file in the current working directory if they do not
already exist. The default system prompt template is copied into the new
directory so you can start chatting immediately.
